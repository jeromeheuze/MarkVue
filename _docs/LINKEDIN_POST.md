🎉 **Launching MarkVue - A Markdown Viewer for the AI Era**

After months of using ChatGPT and Claude, I noticed a problem: Windows has no good way to view markdown files.

So I built **MarkVue**.

**What is it?**
• A clean, fast markdown viewer for Windows
• Syntax highlighting for code blocks
• Dark/light themes
• File association - just double-click .md files
• Completely free and open source

**Why it matters:**
AI tools output markdown constantly. READMEs, documentation, reports, notes - all in .md format. But Windows treats them like text files.

MarkVue changes that.

**Tech Stack:**
Built with Electron + Alpine.js. Open source on GitHub. Available now for download.

**Check it out:**
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/jeromeheuze/MarkVue
📦 Download: https://github.com/jeromeheuze/MarkVue/releases/tag/1.0.1

**Perfect for:**
✅ Developers using AI coding tools
✅ Technical writers
✅ Anyone working with markdown daily

Built this as a portfolio project to showcase problem-solving and full-stack development skills. Feedback welcome! 🚀

🚀 **I Built a Markdown Viewer Because Windows Needed One**

If you use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude, you know they love markdown. But Windows? Not so much.

Double-click a .md file and you get... Notepad. Or VS Code (overkill for just reading a file).

So I built **MarkVue** - a clean, fast markdown viewer designed specifically for Windows.

**Key Features:**
✨ Beautiful rendering with syntax highlighting
🌓 Dark & light themes
🔍 Built-in search (Ctrl+F)
⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts
🔗 Native file association
⚡ Opens instantly, no bloat

**The Tech:**
- Electron for native Windows experience
- Alpine.js for lightweight reactivity
- Marked.js for parsing
- Highlight.js for code highlighting

**Why I Built It:**
This wasn't about building a startup. It was about solving a daily frustration. Sometimes the best projects solve the smallest problems.

**Try It:**
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/jeromeheuze/MarkVue
📦 Download: https://github.com/jeromeheuze/MarkVue/releases/tag/1.0.1

Completely free, open source, no ads, no tracking. Just a tool that works.

Perfect for developers, technical writers, and anyone drowning in .md files.

## Why I Built This

After using AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT, I found myself drowning in markdown files with no good way to view them on Windows. VS Code felt like overkill, and browser extensions were clunky. So I built MarkVue.

npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start

# Build for Windows

```
